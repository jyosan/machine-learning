    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

The curse of dimensionality occurs when there are a large number of features are provided and the combination of their values becomes a combinatorial explosion.\n",

Another weakness is that input features can be continuous, this can be handled by the binning approach to make them discrete. So it is important to pay attention to the input data.\n",

But if you just have occupation can you derive workclass correctly most of the time? My answer is sometimes, so depends on the accuracy. Similar scenario with native country , by knowing ones age its hard to guess the native country. That was my reasoning for determining the independence.\n",
    "This leads me into one topic called Pearson's coeeficient, i had read up a while ago, it was doing the affinity analysis between 2 variables , if the coefficient was r = 0 then there is no relationship if r > 0 then there is a positive relationship , if r<0 then there is negative relationship. I have not seen it used mainly because of I am relatively new, would this be something that would be used on features (if it was mandatory on certain applications that require that features be independent) to determine interdependence?\n",

    "AdaBoost is a type of Ensemble learning where multiple models are employed to build a strong learning algorithm. Adaboost works by chosing a base algorithm and iteratively improving it to by accounting for incorrectly classified examples in the training set.AdaBoost classifer is widely used in face detection where the algorithm has to identify whether a portion of an image is a face or the background.AdaBoost works by choosing a base algorithm and iteratively improving it by accounting for the incorrectly classified examples in the training set. Some of the strengths are : Very few  parameters to tune except the number of iterations. Its fast, simple and easy to train. It can easily identify outliers. Some weakness are : The actual performance of boosting depends on the data and base learner. Boosting can be susceptible to noise (mis-classified examples). There could also be some performance issues when there are many outliers. This model is a good candidate for this problem since the data set if fairly clean and large. Training iterations can be performed quickly to get optimum accuracy.\n",

    "SVM - Support Vector machine is a discriminative classifier defined by a seperating hyperplane. Given labeled training data , the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples.SVMs are widely used in classifications of text , classifications of images and character recognition. Strengths of SVM are that It works very well with clear margin of seperation. It is effective in high dimensional spaces. It is effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. It uses a subset of the points in the training function, so it makes it memory efficient. The weakness are that: It does not perform well on large datasets since the training time required is higher. It does not perform well when the data set has a lot of noise and target classes are overlapping. This model will be a good candidate for the dataset because the data set has reduced noise, the data set is not very huge. The data is also fairly clean."

In the test set both the Fscore and the accuracy score for Adaboost is better than the GNB and SVC. Looking @ the training time, SVC took most of the followed by GNB (which was less) and AdaBoost being the minimum. Adaboost has a Fscore of .7 and is the highest when tested on 100% of the test set. Hence my recommendation and vote is for AdaBoost in the sceanrio"

    "**Answer: ** Adaboost is short for Adaptive Boosting, it is a machine learning meta-algorithm formulated by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire who won the Godel Prize in 2003 for this work. Consider an example where we would like a tree as A, B C or D. If we just go by the texture of the leaf, at this point its a random classification very close to guessing. However if we include multiple features like shape, appearance, bark , leaves , flowers etc and then use that to do a first level classification. The choice of the first training set or several training sets is random. Adaboost then assigns a weight on each training example which determines the probability that the training example should be part of the next training set. Examples with higher weights are more likely to be included in the training set. Hence in this case each training example gets assigned a weight based on whether it correctly classified the tree based on the features or not.\n",
    "After training a classifier , Adaboost  will increase the weight on the misclassified examples so that these examples will make up a larger part of the training set. This will help the next classifier perform better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how Adboost helps the next classifier perform better Question\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from 1 classifier as example\n",
    "\n",
    "Each instance in the training data set is given an initial weight say 1/n where n is the number of training instances.\n",
    "Lets start with 1 model\n",
    "A weak classifier  is prepared on the training data using the weighted samples. The misclassification rate is calculated for the trained model. This is done by\n",
    "error = sum(w(i) * terror(i)) / sum(w)\n",
    "Which is the weighted sum of the misclassification rate, where w is the weight for training instance i and terror is the prediction error for training instance i which is 1 if misclassified and 0 if correctly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we had 3 training instances with the weights 0.01, 0.5 and 0.2. The predicted values were -1, -1 and -1, and the actual output variables in the instances were -1, 1 and -1, then the terrors would be 0, 1, and 0. The misclassification rate would be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "error = (0.01*0 + 0.5*1 + 0.2*0) / (0.01 + 0.5 + 0.2)\n",
    "\n",
    "or\n",
    "\n",
    "error = 0.704\n",
    "A stage value is calculated for the trained model which provides a weighting for any predictions that the model makes. The stage value for a trained model is calculated as follows:\n",

So there might be fewer resources with the education background leading to higher salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Age: I ranked this 3rd because as age increases wisdome increases (hopefully!) experience increases. Certain types of jobs not only require knowledge but also the experience of having done the job over time. Hence the greater the age the salary increases. I will also add 2 more thoughts that, age without knowledge does not add much value, it always important to be a continuous learner, as an example in Technology there is so much change and if the individual does not keep updating their skills age alone will not help. My other factor of choosing age is usually people higher in age may have dependency and may not be able to work for lower saleries due to financial commitments\n",

    "Hours per week - clearly the more number of hours , more moaney is paid. Leaving out the hourly pay, if you worked more hours then the individual must love what they do and hence perform better hence more raise.

Hope there is some visibility seen by his superiors.\n",

I dont agree with the capital loss and capital gain ranked as the 4th and 5th feature because by definition it means the gain or loss from a property. While a gain from a property may urge a person to donate, it is not a consistent feature rather a random occurence , meaning not every observation will have this feature.\n",

They would decide on a monthly charity rate that they can afford based on all situation not on their gain or loss. They would think that i should be able to afford to give that money monthly even if i loose the job.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
